                        We are based at the Johan J Ferreira High Performance Centre on the Paul Roos Gymnasium school grounds. 
                        Once you have passed through the security booms of the school entrance we can be found in the far-left corner. 
                        Here you can find our private consultation rooms with access to the gymnasium.

                        We are affiliated with most medical aids, but unfortunately not all as there is a very large network of
                         medical aids. You are welcome to phone ahead and ask if we are affiliated or otherwise, we can register
                          with the medical aid if arranged long enough before the scheduled appointment.

                        We make use of ICD-10 codes to facilitate as much reimbursement from medical aid as possible, but it remains your responsibility to submit a claim to your medical aid. We are a private practice and you are expected to settle your account after every two sessions.

                        Physiotherapists are first line practitioners therefore you will not need a doctor’s referral. If we are seeing you post-surgery for treatment and rehabilitation a referral would be helpful including what procedure was done and any x-rays, MRI- or CT scan reports. We also work closely with different specialists, GPs and other allied health professionals in order to make the most appropriate referral when needed.

                        We are a private practice and therefore service the public for out-patient visits as well. Home visits can also be arranged if within 5km of the practice.

                        With an initial assessment a subjective history will be gathered through questioning applicable to make a diagnosis. After the subjective assessment a thorough, objective assessment will be done through testing in order to establish a diagnosis. Treatment will then be done accordingly whereafter self-management or rehabilitation will conclude the appointment. In some cases, follow-ups are needed and will be discussed between you and the physiotherapist.
